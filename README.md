# Add your Mixpanel credentials to .env

# 2. Run the AI agent
npm start

# 3. Interactive mode - ask questions in natural language

```

## 🎯 Example Usage

```bash
🔍 Your question: How many users do we have?
📊 USER METRICS:
   Total Users: 45,230
   Active Users (30d): 18,650  
   Growth Rate: 15.0%

💡 GENERATED INSIGHTS:
1. Strong user growth at 15.0% indicates healthy market demand
   Confidence: 87.0%
   Recommendation: Invest in user acquisition channels that are working
   Expected Impact: +25% user growth acceleration
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

```javascript
class ProductAnalyticsAgent {
  constructor() {
    this.mixpanel = new MixpanelMCP();  // ✅ Real Mixpanel tracking
    this.insights = [];                 // AI-generated insights
    this.patterns = new Map();          // Pattern learning
  }

  async analyzeUserBehavior() {
    // Natural language queries → AI insights → Executive summary
    // All tracked to Mixpanel for analytics
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Core Method: `analyzeUserBehavior()`

The main ProductAnalyticsAgent method performs these natural language queries:

1. **"Which features have the highest adoption in first week?"**  
2. **"What actions correlate with 30-day retention?"**  
3. **"Where do users drop off in the onboarding flow?"**  

Then synthesizes AI insights with confidence scores and recommendations.

### Example Output:
```javascript
{
  insights: [
    {
      type: 'retention', 
      discovery: 'Users who complete_profile retain 3x better',
      confidence: 0.89,
      recommendation: 'Prompt all users to complete_profile in first session',
      expectedImpact: '+15% 30-day retention'
    }
  ],
  summary: {
    totalInsights: 3,
    averageConfidence: '88.7%', 
    topRecommendation: 'Simplify email_verification to single tap'
  },
  metrics: {
    adoptionHealth: 5,
    retentionStrength: 0.78,
    onboardingEfficiency: 0.58
  }
}
```

## 💬 Interactive Mode

Ask questions in natural language and get instant insights:

```bash
npm run interactive

🔍 Your question: What drives user retention?
🔍 Your question: Which features are underused?
